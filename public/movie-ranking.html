<h1>The Best Movies According to Nick</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Back to the Future Trilogy</h3>
<p>Back to the Future is my all time favorite movie series. Any time this movie would come on, we would stop everything we were doing and watch the movies. While it is important to watch the movies in order from 1,2,and 3. My personal favorite ranking is 3,1, and then 2. Fun fact about installments 2 and 3; they were originally supposed to just be 1 movie, but the directors thought it would be too long, so they separated them into 2 separate films.</p>

<h3>Twister</h3>
<p>Twister is another great movie, the graphics and plot are great, considering it was made in the 90's. I also really enjoy storms and this makes you feel like you are chasing them.</p>

<h3>Conjuring Universe Movies</h3>
<p>While not a singular movie, I like the Conjuring Universe movies. It really has a scare factor to, where alot of similarly themed movies do not have the graphics or story theme.</p>
